# mRIPT

mRIPT (Magnetic Resonance Imaging Processing Tool) aims to share varied analysis streams useful for application to 3D and 4D MRI DCM and/or NIFTI volumes. 
It is currently a nebulous and semi-aspirational series of functions slowly being pulled together into something usable. 

Functions include: 

* Manually segment an arbitrary number of ROIs slicewise through DCM volumes and automatically output segmented mask volume as NIFTI for further analysis  
* Visualize and output slicewise voxel numbers for brain and ventricle masks for downstream brain volume calculation
* Convert ordered series of DCM volumes with NIFTI brain mask on first time point to skull-stripped, registered volumes plus animated time series GIF
